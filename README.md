## ActiveDOOH - GESTURE

### An OpenNI-based background service.
> _A background-task service that captures Asus Xtion Pro Live stream and detects left and right hands coordinates. These coordinates shall be continuously readable through a localhost socket, as fast as possible._
> _Just make simple and clean code, and don't forget documentation is often more important than code._

### A web API.
> _API will deal with licensing verification, and statistics._
> _These statistics should be as customizable as possible._

### Easy setup.
> _Any configuration shall be editable through a text file (.INI or .XML is good), as ID of the 3D sensor, or Socket Port._
> _A command-line assistant would be appreciable._

***

### Coding Choices.
> * Programming Language: C++
> * Cross-platform Libraries: Qt4, [SimpleSockets](http://sockets.carrierlabs.com/), [OpenNI](http://openni.org/)
